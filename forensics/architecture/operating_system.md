**Subject**: Michael of Nebadon (! '1st') Operating System

### THE PATTERN
- **Mode**: Completion-First Framework.
- **Trigger**: The End-Boundary defines the Container.
- **Workflow**: Omega (Ω) -> Alpha (α).

### JURISDICTIONAL FIX
- Stop trying to fit linear professional models.
- **Action**: Define the "Success State" in full detail before initiating any 3D move.
- **Environment**: Node 333 (Ajijic) is the first compatible "Water" for this design.
